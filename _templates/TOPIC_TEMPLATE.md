## Core Patterns

<!-- Fundamental approaches, implementations, and techniques -->

### Pattern 1: [Pattern Name]

**Intent**: [What problem does this pattern solve?]

**Context**: [When is this pattern applicable?]

**Implementation**:

```python
# Complete, runnable example
def example_pattern():
    """
    Demonstrates [pattern name] with [key technique].
    """
    # Step 1: [description]
    step_one = initialize()

    # Step 2: [description]
    result = process(step_one)

    return result
```

- [Principle 3 with rationale]

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ **Advantages**: [Benefits of this pattern]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disadvantages**: [Costs or limitations]
- üí° **Alternatives**: [When to use different patterns]

**Sources**: [R1][R2]

### Pattern 2: [Pattern Name]

[Same structure as Pattern 1]

## Decision Checklist

<!-- Criteria for determining when and how to apply this topic -->

Use this [topic/pattern/approach] when:

- [ ] **Requirement**: [Specific condition that must be met] [R1]
  - Verify: [How to check if this is true]
  - Impact: [What happens if this isn't met]

- [ ] **Constraint**: [Limitation or boundary condition] [R2]
  - Verify: [How to check if this is true]
  - Impact: [What happens if this isn't met]

- [ ] **Goal**: [Desired outcome or objective]
  - Verify: [How to check if this is true]
  - Impact: [What happens if this isn't met]

**Decision Matrix**:

| Scenario | Use This | Don't Use This | Alternative |
|----------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| [Context A] | ‚úÖ [Reason] | ‚ùå [Reason] | [Alternative approach] |
| [Context B] | ‚ùå [Reason] | ‚úÖ [Reason] | [Alternative approach] |
| [Context C] | ‚ö†Ô∏è [Conditional] | ‚ö†Ô∏è [Conditional] | [Depends on X] |

## Anti-patterns / Pitfalls

<!-- Common mistakes and how to avoid them -->

### Anti-pattern 1: [Problematic Approach]

**Symptom**: [How you recognize this problem]

**Why It Happens**: [Common reasons for this mistake]

**Impact**:
- [Consequence 1]
- [Consequence 2]
- [Consequence 3]

**Solution**: [Correct approach]

**Example**:

```python
# ‚ùå Anti-pattern: [What's wrong here]
def bad_example():
    # This fails because [reason]
    return problematic_approach()

# ‚úÖ Correct pattern: [What's right here]
def good_example():
    # This works because [reason]
    return proper_approach()
```

  - Target: [Acceptable threshold or range]
  - Measurement: [How to calculate this]

- **[Metric 2]**: [What it measures and why it matters]
  - Target: [Acceptable threshold or range]
  - Measurement: [How to calculate this]

**Secondary Metrics**:
- [Supporting metrics that provide additional context]

### Testing Strategies

**Unit Tests**:
```python
def test_pattern_implementation():
    """Verify [pattern] works correctly."""
    result = apply_pattern(test_input)
    assert result == expected_output
    assert result.property == expected_property
```
