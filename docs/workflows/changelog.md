# Changelog

> **For Humans**: This guide defines the format and principles for maintaining changelogs across projects, ensuring clear communication of changes between versions.
>
> **For AI Agents**: Follow this specification when generating changelog entries. Parse existing changelogs according to these patterns. Always maintain reverse chronological order and semantic versioning.

## Overview

A changelog is a file containing a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project. This guide defines the standard format based on Keep a Changelog principles.

## Format Specification

## Release Process

### Workflow

1. **Development**: Add entries to `[Unreleased]` section
2. **Pre-release**: Review and curate entries
3. **Release**: Move `[Unreleased]` to new version section
4. **Tag**: Create git tag matching version
5. **Publish**: Update links and publish

### Release Checklist

- [ ] All changes documented in Unreleased
- [ ] Entries are clear and user-focused
- [ ] Version number follows SemVer
- [ ] Date is correct (YYYY-MM-DD)
- [ ] Links at bottom are updated
- [ ] Git tag created
- [ ] Release notes published

## Anti-patterns

### Missing Context
❌ **Wrong**: "Fixed bug"
✅ **Right**: "Fixed authentication timeout in OAuth flow"

### Technical Jargon
❌ **Wrong**: "Refactored AbstractFactoryBean singleton"
✅ **Right**: "Improved application startup performance"

### Commit Hash Dumps
❌ **Wrong**: Direct commit log paste
✅ **Right**: Curated, meaningful entries

## Evaluation

### Quality Metrics

- **Completeness**: All notable changes included
- **Clarity**: Entries understandable by users
- **Accuracy**: Versions and dates correct
- **Consistency**: Format uniform throughout
- **Linkability**: All versions have anchors
